<P>Justfruitcake has the simple purpose of providing a platform for tracking the travels of virtual
fruitcake. It is one of those side projects that started from a fun and whimsical notion, but took on a
life of its own at a certain point.
<P>Overview:
<ul>
    <li><b>Home</b> - The most popular fruitcake photos (by how often they've been sent).
    <li><b>MyFruitcake</b> - Photos you have uploaded.
    <li><b>MyShipments</b> - Messages you've sent using fruitcakes.
    <li><b>Forum</b> - Discussion area with topics.
    <li><b>MyProfile</b> - Username, email, photo.
    <li><b>Sign-in/Sign-out</b>
    <li><b>About</b>
</ul>

<P>Click <a href="{% url myfruitcake.views.about_sample %}">here</a> for a screenshot. Without having created a sign-in, you can
click on the Justfruitcake message link in an email to open it in Justfruitcake.com and see the fruitcake's travels, but to
send it on or to send other Justfruitcake messsages, you just need to create a sign-in with a verified email address.

<P>FAQ:
<ol>
    <li>I sent a fruitcake so why doesn't it show up in MyShipments? Answer: try hitting F5 to refresh the browser.
    <li>I received a fruitcake message in an email but when I click the link, why do I need to register/sign in?
    Answer: well, it was intended to not be needed, but there hasn't been time to work up the software for that,
    yet.
</ol>
