<div id="shipment_{{ shipment.id }}">
<P>Special fruitcake email {{ shipment.dt|localtime }}:</P>

            <P>I am sending you this fruitcake from <a
                href="http://www.justfruitcake.com">http://www.justfruitcake.com</a>.  
            If you would like to see more about it, such as where  
            it has travelled, just go to its very own shipment information page at <a
                href="http://www.justfruitcake.com/myfruitcake/{{ shipment.fruitcake.id }}/shipment/{{ shipment.id }}">http://www.justfruitcake.com/myfruitcake/{{ shipment.fruitcake.id }}/shipment/{{ shipment.id }}/</a>.</P>
            <P>When you create a sign-on with username and password, you then can send this or other fruitcake to other
            people, come back to check where your fruitcakes go, even upload
            fruitcake photos, or just check out the Justfruitcake forum.</P>

            <P>Happy fruitcake!</P>
