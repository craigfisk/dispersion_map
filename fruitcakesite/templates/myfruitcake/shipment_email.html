<div id="shipment_{{ shipment.id }}">
<P>Special fruitcake email {{ shipment.dt }}:</P>

            <P>I am sending you this fruitcake from <a
                href="http://www.justfruitcake.com">http://www.justfruitcake.com</a>.  
            If you would like to see more about it, such as where  
            it has travelled, just go to its very own shipment information page at <a href="http://www.justfruitcake.com/myfruitcake/shipment/{{ shipment.id }}">http://www.justfruitcake.com/myfruitcake/shipment/{{ shipment.id }}</a>.</P>
            <P>While you are there, you can send the fruitcake on to other people. If you
            also create your own sign-on with username and password, you can bookmark the page and come back later to
            catch up on its travels, send other fruitcake to other people (and follow their travels), even upload
            fruitcake photos, or just check out the Justfruitcake forum.</P>

            <P>Happy fruitcake!</P>
