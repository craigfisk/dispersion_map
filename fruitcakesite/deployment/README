nginx.conf and fruitcake_vassal.ini (<-- django.ini) are the only config files being used here.

nginx.conf is symlinked to /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/  Note the final "/"!!

fruitcake-vassal.ini is the uwsgi control file.  Note carefully how it is symlinked:
    sudo ln -sfn /home/fisk/virt/justfruitcake/fruitcakesite/deployment/fruitcake_vassal.ini /etc/uwsgi/vassal/

The other files are leftover from attempting to get Emperor mode running.
