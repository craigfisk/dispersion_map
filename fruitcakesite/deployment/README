fruitcake_nginx.conf and fruitcake_vassal.ini (<-- django.ini) are the only config files being used here.

fruitcake_nginx.conf is symlinked from /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/  Note the final "/"!!

fruitcake-vassal.ini is the uwsgi control file.  Note carefully how it is symlinked:
    sudo ln -sfn /home/fisk/virt/justfruitcake/fruitcakesite/deployment/fruitcake_vassal.ini /etc/uwsgi/vassal/

The other files are leftover from getting Emperor mode running.

- uwsgi_init_deb.sh is boilerplate.
- etc_init.d_uwsgi is a copy of /etc/init.d/uwsgi, an adaptation for justfruitcake of the boilerplate.
- Not tracked in the justfruitcake git is ~virt/geoip_data, which has its own git.
