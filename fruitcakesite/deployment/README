Justfruitcake config files for nginx and uwsgi Emperor mode (app = a vassal).

1) fruitcake_nginx.conf is symlinked to /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/www.justfruitcake.com

2) fruitcake-vassal.ini is the uwsgi control file.  It is symlinked to /etc/uwsgi/vassals/
     Note carefully how it is symlinked:
        sudo ln -sfn /home/fisk/virt/justfruitcake/fruitcakesite/deployment/fruitcake_vassal.ini /etc/uwsgi/vassals/

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The other files are leftover from attempting to get Emperor mode running.
