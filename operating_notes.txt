2021-10-6 updating to check conversion from master to main on Digital Ocean

-------------------------------

Notes on anonymous access vs. login access.

URL = /
Access only to Home, sign-in, register, about
1) FruitcakeListView.get_queryset - gets the set of top fruitcake
2)          "       .get_contextdata - adds context['user'], which is Anonymous
--> displays / with "hi anonymous"

3) login --> URL = /myfruitcake/
--> displays /myfruitcake/ with "hi lindamagee"
4) / now also shows "hi lindamagee" but is otherwise same as when anonymous.

fruitcakesite/urls.py '^$' 			--> fruitcake_listview
	FruitcakeListView.as_view(model=Fruitcake)
	class FruitcakeListView defined in fruitcakesite/views
myfruitcake/urls.py   'myfruitcake.views' '^$'  --> myfruitcake_listview
	login_required( MyFruitcakeListView.as_view(model=Fruitcake) )
	class MyFruitcakeListView defined in myfruitcake/views

Reflecting the above, in interactive python:
>>> from myfruitcake.urls import *
>>> from myfruitcake.views import *
>>> from fruitcakesite.urls import *
>>> from fruitcakesite.views import *
>>> from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse, resolve

>>> resolve('/myfruitcake/')
ResolverMatch(func=<function MyFruitcakeListView at 0x28020c8>, args=(), kwargs={}, url_name='myfruitcake_listview', app_name='None', namespace='')

>>> resolve('/')
ResolverMatch(func=<function FruitcakeListView at 0x2807b90>, args=(), kwargs={}, url_name='fruitcakelistview', app_name='None', namespace='')

>>> reverse('myfruitcake_listview')
'/myfruitcake/'

>>> reverse('fruitcakelistview')
'/'
