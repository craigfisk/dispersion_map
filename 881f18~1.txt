    Figured out scaling avatars on upload to a constant width, by simply doing the calculation and using image.resize instead of image.thumbnail

Author: Craig Fisk <craigfisk@picocosmos.net>
Date:   Tue Nov 6 23:02:36 2012 -0800

    Changed the userinfo / signin block on forum/fbase.html so that it just says "hi" if anonymous and asks to put in a photo if there is none. Also, tweaked fbasestyles.css to make the userinfo a class and the avatar another class, one div inside the other, on the model of the block of posts.

Author: Craig Fisk <craigfisk@picocosmos.net>
Date:   Tue Nov 6 11:22:06 2012 -0800

    Slight tweak to fruitcakesite.settings so that the app now correctly uses socket.gethostname() to determine if it is running on the zazen deployment server and if so then email support@justfruitcake.com on any 50x errors (setting DEBUG = False), otherwise use DEBUG = True and pop up errors locally using the Django runserver facility.

    Changed forum/views.py where we now want request.user.userprofile instead of request.user.userprofile_set.all()[0], which corresponds to the prior fix to use self.creator.post_set.count() and self.creator.userprofile.avatar

    Finally finally FINALLY got registration by email working completely.  Last step was changing activation_email.txt from /accounts/forum/ to /accounts/forum/?next=/forum/.  Also, in settings.py added socket.gethostname() to test if on zazen deployment server or not, and if so then turn off DEBUG.  Not sure it is actually working. Need to confirm. Also need to clean up the 404.html and 50x.html templates to simplify them.
