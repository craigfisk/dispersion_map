#[lib]
# Since I'm using patched version of django-registration tests/default_backend.py,
# so unignore every parent directory of anything you want to unignore, so in pairs: 
# ignore everything in a directory, but not some certain subdirectory, as follows:
lib/*
#except do not ignore registration directory
!lib/python2.7/site-packages/registration/
!lib/python2.7/site-packages/registration/*
#also subdirectories of registration
!lib/python2.7/site-packages/registration/**/*

# Similarly for geoip, ignore everything 
lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/contrib/gis/geoip/*
# except do not ignore the modified file (use git ls-files to confirm it is tracked).
!lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/contrib/gis/geoip/base.py
